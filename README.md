# BrainConfig
My attempt at creating a generative GUI config library for Forge 1.8.9 (with proper support for array/list types).

I'm creating this because I have tried many config libraries, both for Forge and Fabric.
Some have been okay, but all of them have their issues (most of them being too difficult to understand,
largely due to lack of documentation).

Some big issues I encountered was the lack of array/list type support,
array/list type support not working for custom types, and a lack of keybinding options.
I want to fix all of these issues (and maybe more) with this library.
